## pytest kernel for Jupyter Notebooks

This is a thin wrapper around the standard ipython3 kernel and makes use of the existing [ipytest](https://github.com/chmp/ipytest) module to provide transparent execution of pytest code in Jupyter Notebooks.

### Reasoning

Jupyter Notebooks are a fantastic teaching resource, especially for teaching Python. I have felt its lack when I have taught `pytest` and desired the ability to use Jupyter to show and execute pytest examples.

Fortunately [ipytest](https://github.com/chmp/ipytest) has already done all the heavy-lifting and all that remains was to implement this thin wrapper to create a pytest kernel.
